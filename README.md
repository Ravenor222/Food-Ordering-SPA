## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
### 2. Update the .env file with your correct local information, there are a few things required for this setup.
  - a twilio trial account, this provides you with a twilio phone number to make SMS messages from
    - Twilio ID & Authentication Token can be found in the main user portal upon login / registration
    - official phone is the twilio phone number you have chosen
### 3. at endpoint /api/checkout, near the end of server.js is a function being called (sendMessage()), simply input the phone number you want to act as "the restaurant" and receive the checked out order for confirmation of time (in minutes)

4. Install dependencies: `npm i`
5. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
6. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
